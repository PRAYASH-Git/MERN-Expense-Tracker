# Documentation Improvements

This update adds minor documentation enhancements for clarity and quick onboarding. 
The goal is to make the MERN Expense Tracker easier for new users and learners to run and understand.

## What Was Improved
- Added a short overview of the tech stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).
- Added simple, step-by-step run instructions for local development.
- Clarified how the frontend and backend are organized in the project.
- Added notes for beginners on where to start reading the code.

## Quick Start (Local)
1. Clone this repository to your machine.
2. Open two terminals:
   - One for the **backend** (API / server).
   - One for the **frontend** (React client).
3. Install dependencies in each folder with:
   - `npm install`
4. Configure environment variables as described in the main README (MongoDB URI, JWT secret, etc.).
5. Start the backend server and then the frontend client.
6. Open the local URL shown in the terminal in your browser.

## Notes
This file was added to improve documentation and make the project easier for students and new developers to explore. Further improvements can be made as I continue to learn more about the MERN stack and full-stack development.
